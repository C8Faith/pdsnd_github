#### Project Title
bikeshare.py

#### Description
This project is a program written in python. The goal of the program is to receive user input to direct how to explore the data.

There are three cities:
- Washington
- New York City
- Chicago

There are data logs with user information related to a bike sharing program in each city. The user can choose which file to explore and what filters they would like to apply as part of their exploration.

This project was completed to satisfy the requirements of the Programming with Python Udacity course. More information can be found at their [website](http://udacity.com "Udacity website").

#### Files used
There are three Excel comma separated values files and one python file.
1. new_york_city.csv
2. washington.csv
3. chicago.csv

and
1. bikeshare.py

#### Credits
In creating and completing this project, I spent countless hours mining the internet for information, as I'm learning all good programmers do.

Some of the articles I found especially helpful or particularly enjoyed, and I owe them an additional dose of gratitude. Check them out!

###### _Understand Loops in Python with One Article_
This [piece](https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-loops-in-python-with-one-article-bace2ddba789) was enjoyable and informative and helped increase my understanding of loops.

###### _StackOverflow_
The stack community inspired me, helped me, saved me. The answers to all your questions live here. A great piece of unsolicited advice that I picked up: unless you are doing some sort of wild, brand new thing and breaking ground in the programming world, you most likely do not need to post questions on here. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is where you cut your teeth learning **how to search** for answers.

###### _Corey Schafer's YouTube Channel_
My dude [Corey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS&ab_channel=CoreySchafer "YouTube Channel link") has a killer Pandas tutorial that was a great refresher and learning opportunity. His work is engaging, and it gave me a lot of insight into the world of Pandas. Great supplemental learning.
